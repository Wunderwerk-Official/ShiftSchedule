# Test Plan - Shift Schedule Application

This document outlines the test strategy, coverage areas, and execution instructions for the Shift Schedule application.

---

## 1. Test Layers Overview

| Layer | Framework | Location | Purpose |
|-------|-----------|----------|---------|
| Backend Unit | pytest | `backend/tests/` | State normalization, solver logic, utilities |
| Backend Integration | pytest | `backend/tests/` | API endpoints, database operations |
| Frontend Unit | Vitest | `src/**/*.test.ts(x)` | Pure functions, helpers, utilities |
| Frontend Component | Vitest | `src/**/*.test.tsx` | React component behavior |
| End-to-End | Playwright | `e2e/*.spec.ts` | Full user journeys |

---

## 2. Running Tests

### Backend Tests (pytest)

```bash
# Install dev dependencies
pip install -r backend/requirements-dev.txt

# Run all backend tests as CI does (the ~7 min solver benchmark excluded)
(cd backend && python3 -m pytest tests -q --ignore=tests/test_solver_benchmark.py)

# Run specific test file
python3 -m pytest backend/tests/test_state_normalization.py -v

# Coverage needs pytest-cov, which is not in requirements-dev.txt:
#   pip install pytest-cov && python3 -m pytest backend/tests/ --cov=backend --cov-report=html
```

### Frontend Unit Tests (Vitest)

```bash
# Run once
npm test

# Watch mode
npm run test:watch

# With coverage (needs @vitest/coverage-v8, not in package.json)
npm test -- --coverage
```

### End-to-End Tests (Playwright)

```bash
# Ensure backend and frontend are running first
# Backend: python3 -m uvicorn backend.main:app --port 8000
# Frontend: npm run dev

# Run E2E tests (npm run test:e2e is for Apple Silicon only, see CI section)
npx playwright test

# Run specific test file
npx playwright test e2e/app.spec.ts

# Debug mode
npx playwright test --debug

# Show report
npx playwright show-report
```

- [x] Unpublished weeks return empty calendar
- [x] Published weeks return events
- [x] Token rotation invalidates old tokens
- [x] ETag/Last-Modified headers for caching
- [x] Conditional GET returns 304 when unchanged

### 3.6 Public Web View

### 3.9 My plan and per-user preferences (v1.64)

**Backend Tests** (`backend/tests/test_user_preferences.py` unless noted):
- [x] `GET /v1/me/preferences` returns defaults; PUT/GET round trip; partial input completed, unknown fields ignored
- [x] Invalid input rejected without storing; saved-view cap (12) and name trimming
- [x] Body over 32 KB → 413; the same request without a token → 401
- [x] Isolated per user; deleted with the account; unreadable row → defaults; table added to an older database
- [x] `Location.color` normalization, non-string values dropped, omitted when unset (`test_state_preferences.py`); excluded from the planning fingerprint (`test_fixed_planning_tasks.py`)

**Frontend Tests**:
- [x] `src/lib/myPlan/*.test.ts` — timeline (midnight split, previous-day night), hours, rest/vacation bands, coworkers, layout, colors, labels
- [x] `src/lib/userPreferences.test.ts` — normalization, debounce, no PUT before a successful GET, flush on hide
- [x] `src/pages/usePlanScope.test.ts`, `scrollToTeamAssignment.test.ts`
- [x] `src/components/myPlan/*.test.tsx` — views, header chrome, shift detail, flows, keyboard shortcuts
- [x] `TeamPlanHeader.test.tsx`, `LocationColorPicker.test.tsx` (Auto + presets, v1.71)
- [x] `src/lib/locationColors.test.ts` — automatic location colors in location order, chosen colors never handed out twice (v1.71)
- [x] `src/lib/myPlan/colors.test.ts` — person palette: fills ≥ 15 ΔE00 apart among the first 12, ≥ 9 among all 20, readable text in both themes; location presets: readable label shades, white-text band (v1.71)
- [x] `ScheduleGrid.test.tsx` — label shades alternate per row band and restart per location; stacked lanes share their row band's shade; band in the location's strong color (v1.71)

**E2E Tests** (`e2e/my-plan.spec.ts`, mocked API, in CI):
- [x] Link yourself, change views, jump back into the team plan
- [x] My plan as start page; the team pills carry person colors (no "Color by" switch since v1.69)
- [x] Without a color the first location is blue (Auto); a picked color is saved with the calendar and colors the label shades and the band; Auto clears it (v1.71)
- [x] Phone: the scope switch leads to My plan and hides the planning panels

### 3.10 Team page regressions (v1.64)

**Frontend Tests**: `src/pages/resetSolverAssignments.test.ts` (Reset → Unlocked shifts / Unlocked shifts and rest days), `src/lib/assignmentPolicy.test.ts` (one lock, v1.69), `src/lib/openSlots.test.ts`, `src/components/ui/ConfirmDialog.test.tsx`, `src/App.test.tsx` (502/network keep the session), `src/lib/clinicianSlotOptions.test.ts`, `ScheduleGrid.test.tsx` / `ClinicSheetGrid.test.tsx` (drag and drop).

**E2E Tests** (`e2e/team-page.spec.ts`, mocked API, in CI):
- [x] Rule-violation and split-shift popover items can be clicked
- [x] Dragging into and out of the Vacation row adds and removes the vacation day
- [x] Phone: the open-slots badge switches the day view to the open slot's day
- [x] Template above the column limit: banner and no save, snapshot import refused, snapshot restore backs up the last saved calendar, sign-out asks first
- [x] Reset → Unlocked shifts and Unlocked shifts and rest days also remove planner entries on vacation days; both keep locked shifts, hand-placed ones included (v1.69)
- [x] Times switches between side-by-side and stacked columns and stores the choice (v1.65)
- [x] Moving a planner shift by hand locks it (v1.69)
- [x] A locked shift moved into the Rest Day row becomes a plain rest day entry that Reset → Unlocked shifts and rest days removes (v1.69)

**Frontend Tests (v1.66 compact cells and portrait PDF)**: `ScheduleGrid.test.tsx` (no section block or name in stacked cells, tooltip, +N badge, corner mark, hatched days without a slot, section tints, hover-only fix button, fixed pill keeps it, "Open"), `AssignmentPill.test.tsx` (full name in the pill's tooltip), `IcalExportModal.test.tsx` (page layout choice), `src/pages/printPage.test.ts` (A4 portrait geometry), `PrintWeekPage.test.tsx` / `PrintWeeksPage.test.tsx` (portrait page rule, seven columns, margins), `src/api/client.pdf.test.ts` (layout reaches the request); backend `test_pdf_revision.py` (layout → orientation, viewport and print route).

**Frontend Tests (v1.73 named sections in stacked cells)**: `ScheduleGrid.test.tsx` (a cell of another section than its lane names that section in a tag, before its own time; cells of the lane's section name none).

**Frontend Tests (v1.65 stacked times)**: `src/lib/stackedTeamLayout.test.ts` (time lanes: weekend columns by time, shorter shifts by nearest start, same-time columns by section), `ScheduleGrid.test.tsx` ("stacked times": one column per day, labels, own-time captions, drag between lanes), `TeamPlanHeader.test.tsx` (Times switch).

### 3.11 Background runs (v1.64)

**Backend Tests** (`backend/tests/test_solver_monitor.py`, `test_solver_run_endpoints.py`):
- [x] Watchdog hard stop kills the worker once; salvaged plans end `aborted`; a torn queue message cannot hang the monitor; agent spend recorded once
- [x] Invalid date ranges → 422 with no run row or process
- [x] Discard after apply / of a failed run → 409; discarding an open run twice → 200
- [x] A vacation-hidden unlocked solver row is replaced on apply (`is_replaced_by_draft`)

### 3.12 Holidays by state (v1.72)

**Frontend Tests**: `src/lib/holidays.test.ts` (region filter with date.nager.at's Germany 2026 answer: nationwide entries, matching and other states' counties, no region; region normalizer; region tables), `src/lib/shiftRows.test.ts` (`normalizeAppState` keeps an uppercased code, drops anything else), `SettingsView.test.tsx` (state select, "all states" hint, reload note, load arguments, region of another country, unknown code).

**Backend Tests**: `test_state_normalization.py` (normalizer, non-strings, a pre-v1.72 calendar keeps its bytes and revision through load and save, round trip, clearing restores the old revision), `test_state_routes.py` (GET/POST `/v1/state` round trip, 409 for a stale tab), `test_fixed_planning_tasks.py` (the region is not a planning input).

**E2E Tests** (`e2e/holiday-region.spec.ts`, mocked API and mocked date.nager.at, in CI):
- [x] A chosen state filters the loaded holidays (NRW: Fronleichnam and Allerheiligen, no Buß- und Bettag) and is saved with the calendar; choosing it alone keeps the stored list
- [x] A stored state is shown; another country starts without one


### 3.13 Planning across days and weekly hours (v1.74)

**Backend Tests** (`backend/tests/test_cross_day_repair.py`; the case: a person with a 32 + 8 h cap and 27.5 h booked Mon–Wed, Thursday's 10 h slot and Friday's two 4 h slots of higher priority, nobody else qualified):
- [x] CP-SAT repair mode moves her hours from Thursday to Friday (one more required place) and keeps the best plan when nothing improves
- [x] The same-day rescue cannot fix it (no own placement of Friday blocks)
- [x] `coverage_repair` applies through the gate (2 → 1 open, 3 changes, fixed context unchanged, note text); a complete plan reports `complete`; an illegal solver answer is `rejected`; too little time is `no_time`
- [x] A day-by-day run (scripted model: Thursday gets the long slot) ends with the repaired plan, `cross_day_repair` applied and the note in the run notes
- [x] Batched `candidates` report `week_over_cap_hours` (1.5 h)
- [x] Direct strategy (arena): reply parsing (placements, removals, unparsed lines), one plan answer through the gate (3 proposed, 2 accepted, 1 dropped), digest with weekly hours (`W45 27.5/40`), the range target (`target 9.1±2.3`) and the legal people per open place; placements and removals in the model's order (scarce hours go where the model listed them first) with retry passes while a pass makes progress; every plan block read, fenced notes ignored; only answer text parsed, never reasoning; abort during the call applies nothing; a cut-off answer gets one more call; days left fillable count as model-incomplete and the arena flags their repair
- [x] Repair model = gate (review): a block across two sites with the same-site rule off and work at a site of a fixed two-site day stay in the repaired plan (both tests fail on the stricter model)
- [x] Why a slot stayed open (`test_agent_harness.py`): per open slot the qualified people, those already on it, the directly addable ones and the people each hard rule blocks (vacation 1, weekly hours 1 → main reason weekly hours by the fixed order; nobody qualified → `NO_QUALIFIED`, "nobody is qualified" / "no other qualified person (1 already on it)"), the run-log line, the slot, time and stop bounds
- [x] A finished run with open positions is not called stopped (`test_agent_workflow_safety.py`): `unfinished_dates` empty, apply prompt "The planner finished, but 1 required position(s) remain open; the run log lists each one", `stopped: false`; a skipped day, an open day whose check ran out of time, and a run cut short by its budget keep "incomplete or was stopped" with the day in `unfinished_dates`; a CP-SAT result says "remain open in this draft", a calendar that changed since the run says so; a stored open slot the draft fills applies without the question
- [x] Day digest roster (`test_agent_tools.py`, `test_agent_harness.py`): booked/hard max of the day's ISO week per person (`8/40` with fixed Monday work before a Tuesday range, `4/-` without contract), equal to `_week_hours`; production row shape `…|ytd|0/45|soft work pattern…`; a day's digest includes the earlier days of the run (`0/-` Monday, `8/-` Tuesday); slot list and DAY_SYSTEM_PROMPT name the tools' single-candidate-first order
- [x] A run where the model placed nothing still falls back to the heuristic (`test_prompt_eval.py`); a day the model ended unplanned (`test_agent_workflow_safety.py`) or skipped after a provider failure (`test_agent_retry.py`, `test_agent_integration.py` through the endpoint) is filled by the repair before the final audit and still counts as skipped by the model (arena: invalid for comparison, `test_arena_claude.py`)

**Frontend Tests**: `src/lib/weeklyHours.test.ts` (ISO weeks as Python's `isocalendar`, counting on the start date, pool rows ignored, slot minutes as the gate counts them incl. slots without times = 08:00–16:00, cap contract + tolerance with 5 h default and explicit 0, over only above the cap, label), `src/lib/clinicianSlotOptions.test.ts` (over-limit flag and label, none for people without a contract or already in the slot), `ClinicianPickerPopover.test.tsx` ("Over weekly limit (…)" shown, sorted after people without warnings), `src/lib/solverOutcome.test.ts` (banner reasons most frequent first whatever the input order, ties in the backend rule order, no top-N cut, "a qualified person is still free", "for 1 of 2 slots", "The run ended early." / "ended before it checked" instead of blaming rules; run card "Finished with open positions" only when nothing is unfinished, the incomplete wording for unfinished, aborted and older runs, nothing for applied or discarded runs), `SolverInfoModal.test.tsx` (the rendered run-card line).

## 4. Intentionally Not Covered

The following areas are explicitly excluded from automated testing:

1. **Visual styling** - Covered by manual review; snapshot tests avoided for maintainability
2. **PDF visual accuracy** - Only validates PDF generation, not pixel-perfect layout
3. **Real external API calls** - date.nager.at is never called; `e2e/holiday-region.spec.ts` mocks it and `src/lib/holidays.test.ts` uses its response shape
4. **Browser compatibility** - Playwright runs Chromium only; cross-browser testing is manual
5. **Performance benchmarks** - Not part of functional test suite
6. **Mobile touch interactions** - HTML5 drag-and-drop doesn't support mobile

---

## 5. Test Data & Fixtures

### Backend Fixtures (`backend/tests/conftest.py`)

```python
@pytest.fixture
def default_clinician() -> Clinician:
    """Single clinician with basic qualifications."""

@pytest.fixture
def default_state(default_clinician) -> AppState:
    """Minimal valid AppState with one clinician and one slot."""

@pytest.fixture
def state_with_deprecated_pools() -> AppState:
    """State containing Distribution and Reserve pools for migration testing."""

@pytest.fixture
def test_client() -> TestClient:
    """FastAPI test client with auth token."""
```

### Frontend Fixtures

Test utilities are imported from `@testing-library/react` and custom helpers in test files.

### E2E Fixtures (`e2e/fixtures.ts`)

- Extended Playwright test with diagnostics
- Automatic secret redaction
- Screenshot utilities
- Auth token helpers

---

## 6. CI Integration

Tests are designed to be CI-friendly:

- **Deterministic**: No reliance on real time or external services
- **Isolated**: Each test cleans up after itself
- **Fast**: Unit tests complete in seconds
- **Parallel-safe**: E2E tests use serial execution where needed

### CI Pipeline

The actual pipeline is [.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml](.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml):
backend `python -m pytest tests -q --ignore=tests/test_solver_benchmark.py`
(Python 3.11, from `backend/`); frontend on Node 22 with `npm run typecheck`,
`npm test`, `npm run build`, then the critical Playwright specs
(`e2e/agent-apply.spec.ts`, `e2e/agent-activity.spec.ts`,
`e2e/fixed-assignments.spec.ts`, `e2e/holiday-region.spec.ts`,
`e2e/model-settings.spec.ts`, `e2e/my-plan.spec.ts`, `e2e/team-page.spec.ts`)
against a local Vite dev
server with a mocked API (`page.route`; no backend needed). Run the same set
locally with `npx playwright test e2e/agent-apply.spec.ts
e2e/agent-activity.spec.ts e2e/fixed-assignments.spec.ts
e2e/holiday-region.spec.ts e2e/model-settings.spec.ts e2e/my-plan.spec.ts
e2e/team-page.spec.ts` while
`npm run dev -- --host 127.0.0.1 --port 5173` is running. The full E2E suite is not part of CI. Note that
`npm run test:e2e` forces `PLAYWRIGHT_HOST_PLATFORM_OVERRIDE=mac15-arm64` and
only works on Apple Silicon; elsewhere run `npx playwright test`.

---

## 7. Future Work

Areas identified for future test expansion:

1. **Template builder E2E tests** - More comprehensive slot placement scenarios
2. **Solver performance tests** - Benchmark large schedule solving
3. **Accessibility tests** - Verify WCAG compliance
4. **API contract tests** - OpenAPI schema validation
